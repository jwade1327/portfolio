                <p>
                    I have been working as a Sign Language Interpreter in an educational setting since 2012. I graduated with my Associate's degree from Milwaukee Area Technical College and while I was working as an interpreter I continued my education to earn my Bachelor's degree from Siena Heights University. I am currently enrolled in University of Wisconsin-Extended Campus Coding Bootcamp. Being able to multi-task and problem solve is something I'm familiar with; from work, family life and school I'm able to get things accomplished. Skills such as attention to detail and creativness is second nature to me as an interpreter and I'm looking forward to applying these skills when becoming a developer.
